      <description>Sequencer Tips This is a good lecture on sequencer.
 Tips  Organize the project using Levels so that multiple people can work on different parts of the project without bottlenecks. Check the streaming state of the levels. Make sure that the levels are streaming (if not you will get a black render) A master sequence, sub-sequence and level sequence is basically the same thing, the difference is how they are used and how they are structured.</description>

      <description>Misc  Enable Input  By default the key input is disabled in the standard template.  This is why we need to enable Input in the BeginPlay event   In a level blueprint we do not need to do this   Consume Keyboard event  By default a keyboard event has the property &amp;ldquo;Consume&amp;rdquo; enabled  if it is enabled it will prevent actors with a lower priority to handle the input     Logic Sequence (Flow Control)  If you want to call n number of functions from one input you can use the &amp;ldquo;Sequence&amp;rdquo; (Flow Control) node.</description>

      <description>Below are som notes from a really good video on blueprint communication by Zak Parrish
Blueprint Communications | Live Training | Unreal Engine
Intro  A way for separate individual obejcts to talk to each other Useful for:  Broadcasting an event to a number of listeners Telling a specfic object to do something Quering another object   UE4 has no way to just &amp;ldquo;send a broad signal to everyone&amp;rdquo;  Trivia: had it in UE2, but it wasnâ€™t very efficient   Communication will always involve the following:  A Sending Blueprint At least one Receiving Blueprint   Communication will always require a reference at some point  The Sender or Receiver has to become aware of the other   All Blueprint communication is 1-way  Blueprints can send data back and forth, but it requires both Blueprints to set up their own individual paths of communication Queries are possible, but are initiated by the Sender (still 1-way)    Types of communication  3 primary Blueprint communication Methods  Direct Communication Blueprint Interface message calls Event Dispatchers    When to use  Flow of communication  Is the sender pushing the data to the reciever?</description>

      <description>General Tips  System Units  UE uses centimeter (1 UE unit = 1cm)   Copy assets (as text)  If you select some static meshes and Ctrl C you save the selected assets, their translation etc to the clipboard You can then paste the data to a text editor. This data can the be Ctrl V in Unreal editor to &amp;ldquo;replace&amp;rdquo; the actors.   Anti-Aliasing  Project Settings &amp;gt; Engine &amp;gt; Rendering &amp;gt; Default Settings &amp;gt; Anti-Aliasing Method    Naming Convention Using a good naming convention is important to make the project more efficient to work with.</description>
