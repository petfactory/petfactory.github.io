Blueprint Communications | Live Training | Unreal Engine
Intro  A way for separate individual obejcts to talk to each other Useful for:  Broadcasting an event to a number of listeners Telling a specfic object to do something Quering another object   UE4 has no way to just &amp;ldquo;send a broad signal to everyone&amp;rdquo;  Trivia: had it in UE2, but it wasnâ€™t very efficient   Communication will always involve the following:  A Sending Blueprint At least one Receiving Blueprint   Communication will always require a reference at some point  The Sender or Receiver has to become aware of the other   All Blueprint communication is 1-way  Blueprints can send data back and forth, but it requires both Blueprints to set up their own individual paths of communication Queries are possible, but are initiated by the Sender (still 1-way)    Types of communication  3 primary Blueprint communication Methods  Direct Communication Blueprint Interface message calls Event Dispatchers    When to use  Flow of communication  Is the sender pushing the data to the reciever?</description>
