      <description>This project is a mix of Houdini &amp;amp; Unreal. The road and parts of the environment were modeled in Houdini. The vehicle and cameras were also animated in Houdini. In Unreal I used Megascans for the cliffs, decals to the road and textures for the environment materials. I did the edit in sequencer. The scene is lit by an HDRI Backdrop.
One thing I did in this project was to set the rotation of the HDRI Actor and skylight component per camera angle.</description>

      <description>This project is a mix of Houdini &amp;amp; Unreal. The aim with the project was to refine my Houdini/Unreal workflow and also to test Substrate materials. The road and parts of the environment were modeled in Houdini. The vehicle and cameras were also animated in Houdini. The scene is lit by an HDRI. I used Megascans for the cliffs and some of the textures. Rendered with the path tracer in unreal 5.</description>

      <description>This project is a mix of Houdini &amp;amp; Unreal. The vehicle and floor were animated in Houdini. I used Megascans for some of the props and materials. Parts of the floor were modeled in Houdini. The scene is lit by an HDRI and a directional light. Rendered with the path tracer in unreal 5.4 with 512 samples. The edit was done in sequencer in Unreal. The final color grade was done in DaVinci Resolve.</description>

      <description>This project is a mix of Houdini &amp;amp; Unreal. The vehicle and cameras were animated in Houdini. The Dust sim was done in Houdini using the Sparse Pyro Solver and exported as VDBs to Unreal. The scene is lit by a quite lowrez HDRI, that was also used as a cheap environment. The ground is created with a Heightfield in Houdini and exported as Polygons to Unreal. The material is a Megascan material, and additional details were added using Decals.</description>

      <description>In this project I wanted to learn more about Flip simulations in Houdini. I am using the SOP Flip workflow and I must say that I really like it, quite quick and intuitive to setup. The glass is modeled in Houdini based on the Essence tumbler by Iittala. The fruit and woodboard are Megascans. Rendered in Houdini using Karma XPU. Next steps are exploring ways to add art directable bubbles at intersection of the fluid and glass and improving the shape of the fluid.</description>

      <description>This project is a mix of Houdini &amp;amp; Unreal. The vehicle and cameras were animated in Houdini as were the smoke and RBD sim. I used Unreal for the edit and rendering. The scene is lit by a lowrez HDRI, that was also used as a cheap environment. The ground is basically a plane with a Megascans texture and some decals. Rendered with the path tracer in unreal 5.</description>

      <description>This project is a mix of Houdini &amp;amp; Unreal. The vehicle and cameras were animated in Houdini. The Dust sim was also done in Houdini using Axiom. The scene is lit by a quite lowrez HDRI, that was also used as a cheap environment. The ground is basically a plane with a Megascans texture and some Decals. I did not want to do to much with the environment since the focus was on the animation workflow between Houdini and Unreal.</description>

      <description>Houdini experiment using RBD, rendered with Karma XPU with low samples and denoiser. The robot is modelled in Plasticity and the wooden toys are Megascans.
The wheels are using cone twist constraints and I am using a motor per wheel to drive the robot.

      <description>Houdini ♥️ Unreal
The aim with this project was to explore the workflow between Houdini and Unreal with the main focus on environment building, character &amp;amp; camera animation. I wanted the animation to be shaky, rough and give the feeling of speed.
I also had some software specific aims
 Houdini  KineFX  I wanted to explore rigging in KineFX (the procedural rigging toolset in Houdini) More specifically I wanted to learn how to create KineFX rig HDAs Explore how one rig HDA can drive another Create camera HDA for more quick camera animation   Scripting  Write a custom exporter to export a rig HDA to Unreal sequencer Write a custom exporter for camera animation to Unreal and sequencer     Unreal  General  As I am relatively new to Unreal just starting to use it to produce animation Get to know  Sequencer Movie render queue OCIO workflow     Scripting  Camera &amp;amp; object animation importer      This is a part of an ongoing personal project, so the assets are evolved over time.</description>

      <description>The model was animated using mocap retargeting with KineFX in Houdini. The animation (both the character and cameras) was then exported to a custom format and imported to Unreal Engine 5.3 using pipeline tools that I am developing. The sequence was rendered using the Path Tracer in UE and comped and graded in DaVinci Resolve.
